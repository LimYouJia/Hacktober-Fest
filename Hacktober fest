I just finished my very first year in Dunman High and it was a really fun year. Even though the situation of Covid-19 did not allow me to have the full experience, I still had much fun In dunman High. My friends and seniors were all very caring and helpful to me and I participated in many interesting activities. I really wonder how will my future six years will be. I still remember stepping into the school for the very first time, I felt rather nervous and insecure. After all I was once the senior in my former school and it hoinestly felt weird to be the youngest of the school again. Moreover, I was not sure if I could make friends in this new school. However, the three-day orentation allowed me to familarise myself with the school and I made many friends here. The Chingay Parade bonded the class together and was a highlight of my secondary school life. In term two we started HBL, it was honestly quite difficult for me to adapt and I did not know what lessons to go to ocassionally. HBL was a trying period but with the encouragement of my friends, I was greatly encouraged. Term three was when we all came back to school and we faced a new normal.I could no longer go near my classmates and we all had to wear a mask. Then, term four came and it was the exam period, many of my seniors and friends offered me notes of encouragement. Most of us eventually managed to achieve our dreams and goals Now looking back, we all came in as clueless Year One students but with dreams and goals to achieve. It was an awesome year that we went through and I really look forward to next year!
